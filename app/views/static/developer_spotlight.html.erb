      What we're looking for
    </h2>
    <p class="p-large">
      We're interested in both technical tutorials and general pieces on programming. Successful submissions will be:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Original</strong>. Literally, we want original work (nothing that has been published elsewhere). And more figuratively, we want to see original thought and interesting points of view we can't find anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Well-written</strong>. Our standards are high, and we want everything published on our blog to meet those standards. That said, you don't have to be a professional writer to submit! If the post is original, helpful and interesting, our editorial team is happy to work with you to get it publication ready.
    </p>

      What's in it for you?
    </h2>
    <p class="p-large">
      We pay $400 USD per post. Your tutorial will be published on our blog, and may be shared in our newsletter or showcased as part of our "Tutorial Tuesday" weekly feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      We make every effort to amplify the reach of each and every blog post on our site, and yours will be no exception; you'll have the Nexmo marketing and social media teams behind you getting the word out about your work. Your success is our success

      The process
    </h2>
    <p class="p-large">
      When we receive your submission, our editorial team will evaluate it to see if it's a good fit for the Nexmo blog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Submission is not a guarantee that your work will be published; we reserve the right to decline submissions that aren't right for our platform. But we want to publish your work and will make a good faith effort to work with each and every community member who takes the time to submit. Our goal is simple: we want to see what you're doing with Nexmo's products, and we want you to share your story with the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll be in touch to let you know if we want to publish your post and share the next steps.
