# List Legs

In this building block you will see how to list Legs.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
None | None

```building_blocks
source: '_examples/conversation/leg/list-legs'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation and Legs in order to be able to list Legs. See the Create Conversation building block for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations. You can create Legs within that Conversation by making a Call as outlined in the Conversation topic and our tutorial `Retrieve Conversation details for an in-progress Call.`
```

## Try it out

When you run the code you will list all Legs for the Application.
