# Verify API Overview

The Verify API allows you to send a PIN by SMS and phone to prove a user can be contacted at a specific phone number.

This is useful for:

* Spam protection - prevent spammers from mass-creating new accounts (etc.)
* Hack protection - if you detect suspicious or significant activities, validate that the person using a phone number owns it
* Two-factor authentication
* Reaching users - ensuring you have the correct phone number makes it easy to contact users when you need to

By default, the PIN is first sent via text message (SMS). If there is no reply the Verify API will then try a voice call using text-to-speech (TTS).

TTS messages are read in the locale that matches the phone number. (For example, the TTS for a 61* phone number is sent using an Australian accent for the English language (`en-au`). You can explicitly control the language, accent and gender in TTS from the Verify Request.)

## Default Timings

Assuming that you make a request with the default `pin_expiry` and `next_event_wait` values, your request will be made using the following timings:

1. Make request to the Verify API
2. Nexmo immediately send an SMS containing the PIN
3. Wait 125 seconds for the user to enter the value received
4. Send 1st Text-To-Speech call to read the PIN to the customer
5. Wait 180 more seconds
6. Send 2nd TTS call (with new PIN, as the default `pin_expiry` time is 300s which will have expired)
7. Wait for the user to enter the new PIN for 300 seconds (the default `pin_expiry`)

## Concepts

* **Authentication** - Nexmo Verify API is authenticated with your account API Key and Secret. For more information on see the [Authenticating](/api/verify) in the API documentation.
